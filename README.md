## Testing Benchmarks for Evaluating AutoCCAG

- The directory entitled `benchmarks_2way/` includes all testing benchmarks of 2-way CCAG.

- The directory entitled `benchmarks_3way/` includes all testing benchmarks of 3-way CCAG.

- The directory entitled `benchmarks_4way/` includes all testing benchmarks of 4-way CCAG.

- The directory entitled `benchmarks_5way/` includes all testing benchmarks of 5-way CCAG.

We note that the `Real-world` and `IBM` benchmarks are adopted as the testing set for evaluating the practical performance of AutoCCAG and its state-of-the-art competitors in our work. Hence, we report the results of AutoCCAG and its state-of-the-art competitors on the testing set (i.e., the `Real-world` and `IBM` benchmarks).
